# 📦 CSS Box Model

The CSS Box Model is the basic layout structure of every HTML element.  
Each element is treated as a rectangular box with 4 layers (from inside to outside):

```
Content → Padding → Border → Margin
```

## ✨ Box Model Parts

| Part     | Description                                 |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| `Content` | The actual text or image inside the box     |
| `Padding` | Space between content and border            |
| `Border`  | The line around the padding (and content)   |
| `Margin`  | Space outside the element (creates gaps)    |

## 📌 Syntax Example

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 2px solid black;
  margin: 20px;
}
```

---

## 🧠 Important Points

- `padding` and `margin` can be written like:
  - `padding: 10px 20px;` → top/bottom = 10px, left/right = 20px
  - `margin: 0 auto;` → centers the box horizontally

- Total box size (without `box-sizing`) =  
  `width + padding + border + margin`

- Add `box-sizing: border-box;` to include padding & border **inside** the width.

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
